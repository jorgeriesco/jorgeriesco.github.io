              <p class="sub-title">A BASIC MATRIX FACTORIZATION MODEL</p>
              <p>On this chapter, it says the major callenge is computing the mapping of each
              item and user to factor verctors q<SUB>i</SUB>, p<SUB>u</SUB> &#8712; &#8477;<sup>f</sup>
              , however it doesn't explain an specific way how to for identifying latent factors of
              those vectors. It just mentions SVD technique and its difficulties, but not what it
              does specifictly.</p>
              <p>Moreover, for SVD's diffidulties, it explain the missing values in the user-item
              matrix are a problem for getting the latent factors, and it mentions
              solve this problem by different ways to fill the missing ratings, but it doesnÂ´t
              says specifictly how to.</p>
              <p class="sub-title">LEARNING ALGORITHMS - Alternating least squares</p>
              <p>It isn't clear how to apply the ALS method to minimize the regularized
              squared error. It explain generaly how to do it, but is not enough clear.
              I can't imagine how the procedure is by using ALS.</p>
              <p class="sub-title">ADDITIONAL INPUT SOURCES</p>
              <p>In the formulas, it use &Sigma; <sub>i &#8712; N(u) </sub> x<sub>i</sub>
              to represent a vector for a user, but if I'm not wrong it doesn't says
              what is x<sub>i</sub>, or at least I don't understand well how to get
              that value.</p>
              <p class="sub-title">NETFLIX PRIZE COMPETITION</p>
              <p>The figure 4 is an excelent reference of how this techniques and
              additional constrains improve the Matrix factorization model's accuracy.
              It surprice me how the root-mean-square error decrese considerably by adding
              these methods.</p>
